```
In this vignette we walk through an example using the `wham` (WHAM = Woods Hole Assessment Model) package to run a state-space age-structured stock assessment model. WHAM is a generalization of code written for [Miller et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0339) and [Xu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fog.12236), and in this example we apply WHAM to the same stock, Southern New England / Mid-Atlantic Yellowtail Flounder. 

This is the 2nd `wham` example, which builds off model `m4` from example 1 (full state-space model, numbers at all ages are random effects, logistic normal age-compositions). We assume you already have `wham` installed. If not, see the [Introduction](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/). The simpler 1st example, without environmental effects, is available as a [R script](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/master/inst/example_scripts/ex1_SNEMA_yellowtail_flounder.R) and [vignette](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex1_SNEMA_yellowtail_flounder.html).

In example 2, we demonstrate how to specify and run WHAM with varying

- recruitment models (random, Bev-Holt, Ricker)

- environmental covariate (Cold Pool Index, CPI) process models (random walk, AR1), and

- how the CPI affects recruitment (controlling or limiting)

As in [example 1](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex1_SNEMA_yellowtail_flounder.html), we check that each model converges (`check_convergence()`), plot diagnostics, results, and reference points (`plot_wham_output()`), and compare models using AIC and Mohn's rho (`compare_wham_models()`).

## 1. Prepare `wham`

Open R and load the `wham` package:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(wham)
```

For a clean, runnable `.R` script, look at `ex2_CPI_recruitment_SNEMA_yellowtail.R` in the `example_scripts` folder of the `wham` package install:
```{r eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
file.path(wham.dir, "example_scripts")
```

You can run this entire example script with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.dir <- "choose/where/to/save/output" # otherwise will be saved in working directory
source(file.path(wham.dir, "example_scripts", "ex2_CPI_recruitment_SNEMA_yellowtail.R"))
```

Let's create a directory for this analysis:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# choose a location to save output, otherwise will be saved in working directory
write.dir <- "choose/where/to/save/output"
dir.create(write.dir)
setwd(write.dir)
```

WHAM was built by modifying the ADMB-based ASAP model code [(Legault and Restrepo 1999)](http://sedarweb.org/docs/wsupp/S12RD06%20ASAPdoc.pdf), and is designed to take an ASAP3 .dat file as input. We generally assume in `wham` that you have an existing ASAP3 .dat file. If you are not familiar with ASAP3 input files, see the [ASAP documentation](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nft/ASAP.html). For this vignette, an example ASAP3 input file is provided, `ex2_SNEMAYT.dat`. We will also need a data file with an environmental covariate, the Cold Pool Index, `CPI.csv`.

Copy `ex2_SNEMAYT.dat` and `CPI.csv` to our analysis directory:
```{r eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
file.copy(from=file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","ex2_SNEMAYT.dat"), to=write.dir, overwrite=FALSE)
file.copy(from=file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","CPI.csv"), to=write.dir, overwrite=FALSE)
```

Confirm you are in the correct directory and it has the required data files:
```{r}
list.files()
```

Read the ASAP3 .dat file into R and convert to input list for wham:
```{r}
asap3 <- read_asap3_dat("ex2_SNEMAYT.dat")
```

Load the environmental covariate (Cold Pool Index, CPI) data into R:
```{r}
env.dat <- read.csv("CPI.csv", header=T)
```

We generally abbreviate 'environmental covariate' as `ecov` in the code. In this example, the `ecov` data file has columns for observations (`CPI`), standard error (`CPI_sigma`), and year (`Year`). Observations and year are always required. Standard error can be treated as fixed/data with yearly values (as here) or one overall value shared among years. It can also be estimated as a parameter(s), likewise either as yearly values or one overall value.
```{r}
head(env.dat)
```

## 2. Specify models

Now we specify how the 7 models treat recruitment, the CPI process, and how the CPI affects recruitment:
```{r}
df.mods <- data.frame(Recruitment = c(2,2,3,3,3,3,4),
                      ecov_process = c(rep("rw",4),rep("ar1",3)),
                      ecov_how = c(0,1,0,2,2,1,1), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
n.mods <- dim(df.mods)[1]
df.mods$Model <- paste0("m",1:n.mods)
df.mods <- dplyr::select(df.mods, Model, tidyselect::everything()) # moves Model to first col
```

Look at the model table
```{r}
df.mods
```

We specify the options for modeling recruitment and any environmental covariate(s) using the `prepare_wham_input()` function. WHAM provides 4 options for recruitment (`recruit_model`): 

  1. random walk, 
  2. random about mean, 
  3. Beverton-Holt, and 
  4. Ricker.

The environmental covariate options are fed to `prepare_wham_input()` as a list, `ecov`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
  m=1 # example for first model
  ecov <- list(
    label = "CPI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$CPI),
    logsigma = as.matrix(log(env.dat$CPI_sigma)),
    year = env.dat$Year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (all = 1)
    lag = 1, # CPI in year t affects recruitment in year t+1
    process_model = df.mods$ecov_process[m], # "rw" or "ar1"
    where = "recruit", # CPI affects recruitment
    how = df.mods$ecov_how[m]) # 0 = no effect, 1 = controlling, 2 = limiting
```

There are currently 2 options for the `ecov` process model (`ecov$process_model`): 1) random walk (`'rw'`), and 2) autoregressive (`'ar1'`). We must next specify **where** the `ecov` affects the population; here it is via recruitment (`ecov$where = "recruit"`) as opposed to another process like catchability, mortality, maturity, etc. The options for **how** the `ecov` affects recruitment (`ecov$how`) follow [Iles and Beverton (1998)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110197000221) and [Xu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fog.12236): 

  1. "controlling" (dens-indep mortality), 
  2. "limiting" (carrying capacity, e.g. `ecov` determines amount of suitable habitat), 
  3. "lethal" (threshold, i.e. R --> 0 at some `ecov` value),  
  4. "masking" (metabolic/growth, `ecov` decreases dR/dS), and 
  5. "directive" (e.g. behavioral). 
  
Finally, we specify the **lag** at which CPI affects recruitment (`ecov$lag = 1`, i.e. CPI in year *t* affects recruitment in year *t + 1*).

You can set `ecov = NULL` to fit the model without environmental covariate data, but note that here we fit the `ecov` data even for models without an `ecov` effect on recruitment (`m1` and `m3`) so that we can compare them via AIC (need to have the same data in the likelihood). We accomplish this by setting `ecov$how = 0`.

Options are described in the `prepare_wham_input()` help page. Not all `ecov$how` options are implemented for every recruitment model.
```{r eval=FALSE}
?prepare_wham_input
```

## 3. Run the models

```{r eval=FALSE}
for(m in 1:n.mods){
  # set up environmental covariate data and model options
  ecov <- list(
    label = "CPI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$CPI),
    logsigma = as.matrix(log(env.dat$CPI_sigma)),
    year = env.dat$Year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    lag = 1, # CPI in year t affects recruitment in year t+1
    process_model = df.mods$Ecov_process[m], # "rw" or "ar1"
    where = "recruit", # CPI affects recruitment
    how = df.mods$Ecov_how[m]) # 0 = no effect (but still fit Ecov to compare AIC)

  # (not used in this vignette) can set ecov = NULL to fit model without ecov data
  if(is.na(df.mods$ecov_process[m])) ecov = NULL 

  # generate wham input from ASAP3 and ecov data
  input <- prepare_wham_input(asap3, recruit_model = df.mods$Recruitment[m],
                              model_name = "Ex 2: SNEMA Yellowtail Flounder with CPI effects on R",
                              ecov = ecov,
                              NAA_re = list(sigma="rec+1", cor="iid"))

  # Builds off model m4 in example 1:
  #   full state-space model: NAA_re = list(sigma="rec+1", cor="iid")
  #   logistic normal age-compositions (below)

  # Age comp model = logistic normal pool obs (not multinomial, the default)
  input$data$age_comp_model_fleets = rep(5, input$data$n_fleets) # 5 = logistic normal (pool zero obs)
  input$data$n_age_comp_pars_fleets = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_fleets]
  input$data$age_comp_model_indices = rep(5, input$data$n_indices) # 5 = logistic normal (pool zero obs)
  input$data$n_age_comp_pars_indices = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_indices]
  n_catch_acomp_pars = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_fleets[which(apply(input$data$use_catch_paa,2,sum)>0)]]
  n_index_acomp_pars = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_indices[which(apply(input$data$use_index_paa,2,sum)>0)]]
  input$par$catch_paa_pars = rep(0, sum(n_catch_acomp_pars))
  input$par$index_paa_pars = rep(0, sum(n_index_acomp_pars))

  # Selectivity = logistic, not age-specific as in ex1
  #   2 pars per block instead of n.ages
  #   sel pars of indices 4/5 fixed at 1.5, 0.1 (specified via neg phase in ex2_SNEMAYT.dat)
  input$par$logit_selpars[1:4,7:8] <- 0 # last 2 rows will not be estimated (mapped to NA)

  # Fit model
  mod <- fit_wham(input, do.retro=TRUE, do.osa=TRUE)

  # Save model
  saveRDS(mod, file=paste0(df.mods$Model[m],".rds"))

  # Plot output in new subfolder
  plot_wham_output(mod=mod, dir.main=file.path(getwd(),df.mods$Model[m]), out.type='html')
}
```

## 4. Check for convergence

```{r include=FALSE}
data(vign2_conv)
data(vign2_res)
```

Collect all models into a list.
```{r eval=FALSE}
mod.list <- paste0(df.mods$Model,".rds")
mods <- lapply(mod.list, readRDS)
```

There is no indication that any of the models failed to converge. In addition, SE estimates are calculable for all models (invertible Hessian, `TMB::sdreport()` succeeds).
```{r eval=FALSE}
vign2_conv <- lapply(mods, function(x) capture.output(check_convergence(x)))
for(m in 1:n.mods) cat(paste0("Model ",m,":"), vign2_conv[[m]], "", sep='\n')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
for(m in 1:7) cat(paste0("Model ",m,":"), vign2_conv[[m]], "", sep='\n')
```

## 5. Compare models

Calculate AIC and Mohn's rho using `compare_wham_models()`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
df.aic <- compare_wham_models(mods, sort=FALSE)$tab # can't sort yet bc going to make labels prettier
df.mods <- cbind(df.mods, df.aic)
```

Print and save the results table. `m6` has the lowest AIC (Bev-Holt recruitment, CPI modeled as AR1, controlling effect of CPI on recruitment).
```{r eval=FALSE}
# make results table prettier
rownames(df.mods) <- NULL
df.mods$Recruitment <- dplyr::recode(df.mods$Recruitment, `2`='Random', `3`='Bev-Holt', `4`='Ricker')
df.mods$ecov_how <- dplyr::recode(df.mods$ecov_how, `0`='---',`1`='Controlling', `2`='Limiting', `4`='Masking')
df.mods$NLL <- sapply(mods, function(x) round(x$opt$objective,3))
df.mods <- df.mods[order(df.mods$dAIC),]
save("df.mods", file="vign2_res.RData")

df.mods
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
vign2_res
```

## 6. Results

There are 3 options for plotting WHAM output. The default (`out.type='html'`) creates and opens an HTML file with plots organized into tabs (code modified from [`r4ss::SS_html()`](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/blob/master/R/SS_html.R)):
```{r eval=FALSE}
# save output plots in subfolder for each model
for(m in 1:n.mods) plot_wham_output(mod=mods[[m]], dir.main=file.path(getwd(), df.mods$Model[m]), out.type='html')
```

### Cold Pool Index (CPI)

Models that included an effect of the Cold Pool Index on recruitment were strongly supported by AIC over models without CPI effects (`m2` and `m4-7` lower AIC than `m1` and `m3`). Note that we can compare models with and without a CPI effect on recruitment using AIC because we also fit the CPI data in the models without the effect (`m1` and `m3`).

Comparing `m4` and `m5` demonstrates that the CPI was best modeled as an AR1 process (`m5`) instead of a random walk (`m4`), since this was the only difference between the two models and `m5` had lower AIC. In addition, the one-step-ahead residuals for the CPI from `m5` (right) are smaller and conform more closely to a normal distribution than in `m4` (left):

![OSA residuals for the CPI, model 4.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timjmiller/wham/master/vignettes/ex2_plots/OSAresid_ecov_m4.png){ width=45% }![OSA residuals for the CPI, model 5.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timjmiller/wham/master/vignettes/ex2_plots/OSAresid_ecov_m5.png){ width=45% }

Compared to the base model (`m1`, left), the best model that included CPI and SSB effects on recruitment, (`m6`, right) reduced the retrospective pattern in recruitment, $\rho_R$, very slightly from 0.231 to 0.191.

### Recruitment

Beverton-Holt recruitment was preferred over random (`m4` lower AIC than `m2`) and weakly preferred over Ricker (`m6` lower AIC than `m7`). Models that included both Bev-Holt and CPI effects on recruitment had lower AIC than the model with Bev-Holt but without the CPI (`m4` vs. `m3`). Adding the CPI effect to the Bev-Holt explains some of the variability around the stock-recruit curve, which resulted in `m4` (right) estimating lower $\sigma^2_R$ than `m3` (left).

![Bev-Holt fit from m3, without a CPI effect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timjmiller/wham/master/vignettes/ex2_plots/SSB_Rec_m3.png){ width=45% }![Bev-Holt fit from m4, WITH a CPI effect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timjmiller/wham/master/vignettes/ex2_plots/SSB_Rec_m4.png){ width=45% }

There was very weak evidence that the Cold Pool *controls* recruitment, as opposed to *limiting* recruitment (`m5` vs. `m6`). The hypothesis that the CPI indicates the amount of suitable habitat for juvenile yellowtail flounder corresponds to a limiting effect, as in `m5`. In contrast, a controlling effect (as in `m6`) causes density-independent mortality. For more explanation, see [Iles & Beverton (1998)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110197000221).

### Stock status

Whether or not to include a stock-recruit function and/or the CPI did not have a great influence on estimated stock status. Specifically, the models hardly differed in their estimation of the probability that the stock was overfished, $Pr[SSB < 0.5 \: SSB_{40\%}]$. All models estimated with 100% probability that the stock was not experiencing overfishing in 2011, $F < F_{40\%}$.
