In this vignette we walk through an example using the `wham` (WHAM = Woods Hole Assessment Model) package to run a state-space age-structured stock assessment model. WHAM is a generalization of code written for [Miller et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0339) and [Xu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fog.12236), and in this example we apply WHAM to the same stock, Southern New England / Mid-Atlantic Yellowtail Flounder. 

This is the 5th WHAM example, which builds off [example 2](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/mortality/inst/example_scripts/ex2_CPI_recruitment_SNEMA_yellowtail.R):

- full state-space model (numbers-at-age are random effects for all ages, `input$data$use_NAA_re = 1`)
- logistic normal age compositions, pooling zero observations (`input$data$age_comp_model_fleets = 5` and `input$data$age_comp_model_indices = 5`)
- random-about-mean recruitment (`recruit_model = 2`)
- 5 indices
- fit to 1973-2011 data

We assume you already have `wham` installed. If not, see the [README](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham#installation-and-basic-use). The simpler 1st example, without environmental effects or time-varying $M$, is available as a [R script](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/master/inst/example_scripts/ex1_SNEMA_yellowtail_flounder.R) and [vignette](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/master/vignettes/ex1_SNEMA_yellowtail_flounder.Rmd).

In example 5, we demonstrate how to specify and run WHAM with the following options for natural mortality:

- not estimated (fixed at input values)
- one value, $M$
- age-specific, $M_a$ (independent)
- function of weight-at-age, $M_{y,a} = \mu_M * W_{y,a}^b$
- AR1 deviations by age (random effects), $M_{y,a} = \mu_M + \delta_a \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \delta_a \sim \mathcal{N} (\rho_a \delta_{a-1}, \sigma^2_M)$
- AR1 deviations by year (random effects), $M_{y,a} = \mu_M + \delta_y \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \delta_y \sim \mathcal{N} (\rho_y \delta_{y-1}, \sigma^2_M)$
- 2D AR1 deviations by age and year (random effects), $M_{y,a} = M_a + \delta_{y,a} \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \delta_{y,a} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$

We also demonstrate alternate specifications for the link between $M$ and an environmental covariate, the Gulf Stream Index (GSI), as in [O'Leary et al. (2019)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0092):

- none
- linear (in log-space), $M_{y,a} = e^{\mathrm{log}\mu_M + \beta_1 E_y}$
- quadratic (in log-space), $M_{y,a} = e^{\mathrm{log}\mu_M + \beta_1 E_y + \beta_2 E^2_y}$

Note that you can specify more than one of the above effects on $M$, although the model may not be estimable. For example, the most complex model with weight-at-age, 2D AR1 age- and year-deviations, and a quadratic environmental effect: $M_{y,a} = e^{\mathrm{log}\mu_M + b W_{y,a} + \beta_1 E_y + \beta_2 E^2_y + \delta_{y,a}}$.

## 1. Load data

Open R and load the `wham` package:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(wham)
library(dplyr)
```

For a clean, runnable `.R` script, look at `ex5_GSI_M.R` in the `example_scripts` folder of the `wham` package install:
```{r eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
file.path(wham.dir, "example_scripts")
```

You can run this entire example script with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.dir <- "choose/where/to/save/output" # otherwise will be saved in working directory
source(file.path(wham.dir, "example_scripts", "ex5_GSI_M.R"))
```

Let's create a directory for this analysis:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# choose a location to save output, otherwise will be saved in working directory
write.dir <- "choose/where/to/save/output"
dir.create(write.dir)
setwd(write.dir)
```

We need the same ASAP data file as in [example 2](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/mortality/inst/example_scripts/ex2_CPI_recruitment_SNEMA_yellowtail.R), and the environmental covariate (GSI). Let's copy `ex2_SNEMAYT.dat` and `GSI.csv` to our analysis directory:
```{r eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
file.copy(from=file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","ex2_SNEMAYT.dat"), to=write.dir, overwrite=FALSE)
file.copy(from=file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","GSI.csv"), to=write.dir, overwrite=FALSE)
```

Confirm you are in the correct directory and it has the required data files:
```{r eval=FALSE}
list.files()
```

Read the ASAP3 .dat file into R and convert to input list for wham:
```{r eval=FALSE}
asap3 <- read_asap3_dat("ex2_SNEMAYT.dat")
```

Load the environmental covariate (Gulf Stream Index, GSI) data into R:
```{r}
env.dat <- read.csv("GSI.csv", header=T)
head(env.dat)
```

The GSI does not have a standard error estimate, either for each yearly observation or one overall value. In such a case, WHAM can estimate the observation error for the environmental covariate, either as one overall value, $\sigma_E$, or yearly values as random effects, $\mathrm{log}\sigma_{E_y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathrm{log}\sigma_E, \sigma^2_{\sigma_E})$. In this example we choose the simpler option and estimate one observation error parameter, shared across years.

## 2. Specify models

Now we specify several models with different options for natural mortality:
```{r}
df.mods <- data.frame(M_model = c(rep("---",3),"age-specific","weight-at-age",rep("constant",6),"age-specific","age-specific",rep("constant",3),"---"),
                      M_re = c(rep("none",6),"ar1_y","2dar1","none","none","2dar1","none","2dar1",rep("ar1_a",3),"2dar1"),
                      Ecov_process = rep("ar1",17),
                      Ecov_link = c(0,1,2,rep(0,5),1,2,1,2,2,0,1,2,0), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
n.mods <- dim(df.mods)[1]
df.mods$Model <- paste0("m",1:n.mods)
df.mods <- df.mods %>% select(Model, everything()) # moves Model to first col
```

Look at the model table:
```{r}
df.mods
```

## 3. Natural mortality options

Next we specify the options for modeling natural mortality by including an optional list argument, `M`, to the  `prepare_wham_input` function (see the `?prepare_wham_input` help page). `M` specifies estimation options and can overwrite M-at-age values specified in the ASAP data file. By default (i.e. `M` is `NULL` or not included), the M-at-age matrix from the ASAP data file is used (M fixed, not estimated). `M` is a list with the following entries:

- `$model`: Natural mortality model options.
  - `"constant"`: estimate a single $M$, shared across all ages and years.
  - `"age-specific"`: estimate $M_a$ independent for each age, shared across years.
  - `"weight-at-age"`: estimate $M$ as a function of weight-at-age, $M_{y,a} = \mu_M * W_{y,a}^b$, as in [Lorenzen (1996)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1996.tb00060.x) and [Miller & Hyun (2018)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0035).
- `$re`: Time- and age-varying random effects on $M$.
  - `"none"`: $M$ constant in time and across ages (default).
  - `"iid"`: $M$ varies by year and age, but uncorrelated.
  - `"ar1_a"`: $M$ correlated by age (AR1), constant in time.
  - `"ar1_y"`: $M$ correlated by year (AR1), constant by age.
  - `"2dar1"`: $M$ correlated by year and age (2D AR1), as in [Cadigan (2016)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0047).
- `$initial_means`: Initial/mean M-at-age vector, with length = number of ages (if `$model = "age-specific"`) or 1 (if `$model = "weight-at-age"` or `"constant"`). If `NULL`, initial mean M-at-age values are taken from the first row of the MAA matrix in the ASAP data file.
- `$est_ages`: Vector of ages to estimate age-specific $M_a$ (others will be fixed at initial values). E.g. in a model with 6 ages, `$est_ages = 5:6` will estimate $M_a$ for the 5th and 6th ages, and fix $M$ for ages 1-4. If `NULL`, $M$ at all ages is fixed at `M$initial_means` (if not `NULL`) or row 1 of the MAA matrix from the ASAP file (if `M$initial_means = NULL`).
- `$logb_prior`: (Only for weight-at-age model) TRUE or FALSE (default), should a $\mathcal{N}(0.305, 0.08)$ prior be used on `log_b`? Based on Fig. 1 and Table 1 (marine fish) in [Lorenzen (1996)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1996.tb00060.x).

For example, to fit model `m1`, fix $M_a$ at values in ASAP file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- NULL # or simply leave out of call to prepare_wham_input
```

To fit model `m6`, estimate one $M$, constant by year and age:

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- list(model="constant", est_ages=1)
```

And to fit model `m8`, estimate mean $M$ with 2D AR1 deviations by year and age:

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- list(model="constant", est_ages=1, re="2dar1")
```

To fit model `m17`, use the $M_a$ values specified in the ASAP file, but with 2D AR1 deviations as in [Cadigan (2016)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0047):

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- list(re="2dar1")
```

## 4. Linking *M* to an environmental covariate (GSI)

As described in [example 2](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/mortality/inst/example_scripts/ex2_CPI_recruitment_SNEMA_yellowtail.R), the environmental covariate options are fed to `prepare_wham_input` as a list, `ecov`. This example differs from example 2 in that:

- `$logsigma = "est_1"`: estimate the observation error for the GSI (one overall value for all years). The other option is `"est_re"` to allow the GSI observation error to have yearly fluctuations (random effects). The Cold Pool Index in example 2 had yearly observation errors given.
- `$lag = 0`: GSI in year *t* affects $M$ in year *t*, instead of year *t+1*.
- `$where = "M"`: GSI affects $M$, instead of recruitment.
- `$how`: `ecov$how = 0` estimates the GSI time-series model (AR1) for models without a GSI-M effect, in order to compare AIC with models that do include a GSI-M effect. Setting `ecov$how = 1` is necessary to allow a GSI-M effect.
- `$link_model`: specifies the model linking GSI to $M$. Can be `NA` (no effect, default), `"linear"`, or `"poly-x"` (where x is the degree of a polynomial). In this example we demonstrate models with no GSI-M effect, a linear GSI-M effect, and a quadratic GSI-M effect (`"poly-2"`). WHAM includes a function to calculate orthogonal polynomials in TMB, akin to the [`poly()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/poly) function in R.

For example, the `ecov` list for model `m3` with a quadratic GSI-M effect:

```{r eval=FALSE}
  # example for model m3
  ecov <- list(
    label = "GSI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$GSI),
    logsigma = 'est_1', # estimate obs sigma, 1 value shared across years
    year = env.dat$year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    lag = 0, # GSI in year t affects M in same year
    process_model = "ar1", # GSI modeled as AR1 (random walk would be "rw")
    where = "M", # GSI affects natural mortality
    how = 1, # include GSI effect on M
    link_model = "poly-2") # quadratic GSI-M effect
```

Note that you can set `ecov = NULL` to fit the model without environmental covariate data, but here we fit the `ecov` data even for models without GSI effect on $M$ (`m1`, `m4-8`, `m14`) so that we can compare them via AIC (need to have the same data in the likelihood). We accomplish this by setting `ecov$how = 0` and `ecov$process_model = "ar1"`.

## 5. Run all models

All models use the same options for recruitment (random-about-mean, no stock-recruit function) and selectivity (logistic, with parameters fixed for indices 4 and 5).

```{r eval=FALSE}
env.dat <- read.csv("GSI.csv", header=T)
for(m in 1:n.mods){
  ecov <- list(
    label = "GSI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$GSI),
    logsigma = 'est_1', # estimate obs sigma, 1 value shared across years
    year = env.dat$year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    lag = 0, # GSI in year t affects M in same year
    process_model = df.mods$Ecov_process[m], # "rw" or "ar1"
    where = "M", # GSI affects natural mortality
    how = ifelse(df.mods$Ecov_link[m]==0,0,1),
    link_model = c(NA,"linear","poly-2")[df.mods$Ecov_link[m]+1])

  m_model <- df.mods$M_model[m]
  if(df.mods$M_model[m] == '---') m_model = "age-specific"
  if(df.mods$M_model[m] %in% c("constant","weight-at-age")) est_ages = 1
  if(df.mods$M_model[m] == "age-specific") est_ages = 1:asap3$dat$n_ages
  if(df.mods$M_model[m] == '---') est_ages = NULL
  
  M <- list(
    model = m_model,
    re = df.mods$M_re[m],
    est_ages = est_ages
  )
  if(m_model %in% c("constant","weight-at-age")) M$initial_means = 0.28

  input <- prepare_wham_input(asap3, recruit_model = 2,
                              model_name = "Ex 5: GSI effects on M",
                              ecov = ecov,
                              selectivity=list(model=rep("logistic",6),
                                               initial_pars=c(rep(list(c(3,3)),4), list(c(1.5,0.1), c(1.5,0.1))),
                                               fix_pars=c(rep(list(NULL),4), list(1:2, 1:2))),
                              M=M)

  # overwrite age comp model (all models use logistic normal)
  input$data$age_comp_model_fleets = rep(5, input$data$n_fleets) # 5 = logistic normal (pool zero obs)
  input$data$n_age_comp_pars_fleets = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_fleets]
  input$data$age_comp_model_indices = rep(5, input$data$n_indices) # 5 = logistic normal (pool zero obs)
  input$data$n_age_comp_pars_indices = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_indices]
  n_catch_acomp_pars = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_fleets[which(apply(input$data$use_catch_paa,2,sum)>0)]]
  n_index_acomp_pars = c(0,1,1,3,1,2)[input$data$age_comp_model_indices[which(apply(input$data$use_index_paa,2,sum)>0)]]
  input$par$catch_paa_pars = rep(0, sum(n_catch_acomp_pars))
  input$par$index_paa_pars = rep(0, sum(n_index_acomp_pars))

  # Full state-space model, abundance is the state vector
  input$data$use_NAA_re = 1
  input$data$random_recruitment = 0
  input$map = input$map[!(names(input$map) %in% c("log_NAA", "log_NAA_sigma", "mean_rec_pars"))] # remove from map (i.e. estimate)
  input$map$log_R = factor(rep(NA, length(input$par$log_R)))
  input$random = c(input$random, "log_NAA")

  # Fit model
  btime = Sys.time()
  mod <- fit_wham(input, do.retro=T, do.osa=F) # turn off OSA residuals to save time
  mod$runtime = round(difftime(Sys.time(), btime, units = "mins"),1)

  # Save model
  saveRDS(mod, file=paste0(df.mods$Model[m],".rds"))

  # Plot output in new subfolder
  # plot_wham_output(mod=mod, dir.main=file.path(getwd(),df.mods$Model[m]), out.type='html')
  
  # Do projections
  # mod_proj <- project_wham(mod)
  # saveRDS(mod_proj, file=paste0(df.mods$Model[m],"_proj.rds"))
}
```

## 6. Compare models

```{r include=FALSE}
data(vign5_res)
# data(vign5_MAA)
```

Collect all models into a list.
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
mod.list <- paste0(df.mods$Model,".rds")
mods <- lapply(mod.list, readRDS)
```

Get model convergence and stats.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df.mods$pdHess <- sapply(mods, function(x) x$sdrep$pdHess)
df.mods$runtime <- sapply(mods, function(x) x$runtime)
df.mods$NLL <- sapply(mods, function(x) round(x$opt$objective,3))
df.aic <- as.data.frame(compare_wham_models(mods, sort=FALSE, calc.rho=T)$tab)
df.aic$AIC[df.mods$pdHess==FALSE | is.na(df.mods$pdHess)] <- NA
minAIC <- min(df.aic$AIC, na.rm=T)
df.aic$dAIC <- round(df.aic$AIC - minAIC,1)
df.mods <- cbind(df.mods, df.aic)
```

Make results table prettier.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df.mods$Ecov_link <- c("---","linear","poly-2")[df.mods$Ecov_link+1]
df.mods$M_re[df.mods$M_re=="none"] = "---"
colnames(df.mods)[2] = "M_est"
rownames(df.mods) <- NULL
```

Look at results table.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df.mods
```


## 7. Results

Model `m8` (estimate mean $M$ and 2D AR1 deviations by year and age, no GSI effect) had the lowest AIC and was overwhelmingly supported relative to the other models (bold in table below).

In the table, `Pos def Hessian` highlights models for which `TMB::sdreport(mod)` successfully inverted the Hessian and produced SE estimates for all (fixed effect) parameters. This information is stored in `mod$na_sdrep` (should be `FALSE`) and `mod$sdrep$pdHess` (should be `TRUE`).

```{r echo=FALSE}
vign5_res[,11:13] = round(vign5_res[,11:13], 3)
vign5_res[,6] = ifelse(vign5_res[,6]==FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)

# colnames(vign5_res)[1] = ""
# colnames(vign5_res)[2] = "M model"
# colnames(vign5_res)[4] = "GSI"
# colnames(vign5_res)[5] = "GSI\nlink"
# colnames(vign5_res)[6] = "Pos def\nHessian"
# colnames(vign5_res)[7] = "Runtime\n(min)"
# colnames(vign5_res)[11] = "$\\rho_{R}$"
# colnames(vign5_res)[12] = "$\\rho_{SSB}$"
# colnames(vign5_res)[13] = "$\\rho_{\\overline{F}}$"
# kable(vign5_res) %>%
#   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed", "responsive"))

posdef = which(vign5_res$na_sdrep == TRUE)
# posdef = which(vign5_res$pdHess == TRUE)
thebest = which(vign5_res$dAIC == 0)
vign5_res %>%
  # mutate(na_sdrep = cell_spec(na_sdrep, "html", bold = ifelse(na_sdrep == TRUE,TRUE,FALSE))) %>%
  # select(everything()) %>%
  dplyr::rename("M model"="M_est", "GSI"="Ecov_process", "GSI link"="Ecov_link",

```

#### Estimated *M*

- Models allowed to estimate mean $M$ increased $M$ compared to the fixed values in `m1-3` (more green/yellow than blue).
- Models that estimated $M_a$ had highest $M_a$ for ages 4-5.
- Models that estimated $M_y$ had higher $M_y$ in the early 1990s and around 2000.

#### Retrospective patterns

Compared to `m1`, the retrospective pattern for `m8` was worse for recruitment (`m8` 0.31, `m1` 0.26) but improved for SSB (`m8` 0.01, `m1` 0.11) and F (`m8` -0.03, `m1` -0.13). In general, models with GSI effects or 2D AR1 deviations on $M$ had reduced retrospective patterns compared to the status quo (`m1`) and models with 1D AR1 random effects on $M$. Compare the retrospective patterns of numbers-at-age, SSB, and F for models `m1` (left, fixed $M_a$) and `m8` (right, estimated $M$ + 2D AR1 deviations).

It is also worth noting that, although the Hessian was not positive definite, model `m17` had the lowest retrospective pattern across all numbers-at-age, SSB, and F. Model `m17` left $M_a$ fixed at the values from the ASAP data file (as in `m1`) and estimated 2D AR1 deviations around these mean $M_a$. This is how $M$ was modeled in [Cadigan (2016)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0047).

#### Stock status

Compared to `m1` (left), `m8` (center) estimated higher *M*, lower and more uncertain *F*, and higher SSB -- a much rosier picture of the stock status through time. Model `m17` (right) is intermediate between `m1` and `m8`.

### Yet more *M* options

If you want to estimate M-at-age shared/mirrored among *some but not all ages*, you'll need to modify `input$map$M_a` after calling `prepare_wham_input`.
